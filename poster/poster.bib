	abstract = {Many countries produce significant quantities of nuclear waste which will have to be permanently and safely placed in a repository. We develop a mixed integer program that determines where to place each waste package of a specific waste type in a given time period with the goal of minimizing heat load concentration within a repository. Operational constraints include: (1) heat load limitations, (2) location and time at which waste packages can be placed, and (3) the number of waste packages that must be placed based on type and time period. Although applicable to other settings, we use the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada as a case study. Each of the three objectives used for minimizing heat load concentration improves upon existing greedy and sequential filling methods. Existing filling methods give at least a 17 \% to an 873 \% higher, i.e., worse, heat load concentration in the repository with respect to these objectives than do optimal methods. Enhancements, i.e., symmetry reduction constraints, perturbations, and heuristics, increase the size of solvable problem instances. This research can be applied to any deep geologic repository planned for operation around the world with slight modifications to incorporate site-specific objectives and constraints.},

	abstract = {A combination of transient heat transfer analytical solutions for a finite line source, a 
series of point sources, and a series of parallel infinite line sources were combined with 
a quasi-steady-state multi-layered cylindrical solution to simulate the temperature 
response of a deep geologic radioactive waste repository with multi-layered natural and 
engineered barriers.  
This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers 
to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, 
salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint.
This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large 
number of alternative disposal options and design configurations.  More than 100
combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and 
surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the evolution of the engineered barrier design for the proposed Yucca Mountain disposal system. Initially, the underground facility used a fairly standard panel and drift layout excavated mostly by drilling and blasting. By 1993, the layout of the underground facility was changed to accommodate construction by a tunnel boring machine. Placement of the repository in unsaturated zone permitted an extended period without backﬁlling; placement of the waste package in an open drift permitted use of much larger, and thus hotter packages. Hence in 1994, the underground facility design switched from ﬂoor emplacement of waste in small, single walled stainless steel or nickel alloy containers to in-drift emplacement of waste in large, double-walled containers. By 2000, the outer layer was a high nickel alloy for corrosion resistance and the inner layer was stainless steel for structural strength. Use of large packages facilitated receipt and disposal of high volumes of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, in-drift package placement saved excavation costs. Options considered for in-drift emplacement included different heat loads and use of backﬁll. To avoid dripping on the package during the thermal period and the possibility of localized corrosion, titanium drip shields were added for the disposal drifts by 2000. In addition, a handling canister, sealed at the reactor to eliminate further handling of bare fuel assemblies, was evaluated and eventually adopted in 2006. Finally, staged development of the underground layout was adopted to more readily adjust to changes in waste forms and Congressional funding.},

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) is being developed for the U.S. Department of Energyâs Office of Nuclear Energy by the national laboratories. An important part of UNF-ST\&DARDS is the Unified Database (UDB), which contains information that can support a variety of activities including fuel storage, fuel transportation, and disposal-related system analysis. Currently, the main application of the UDB is to support evaluation of the characteristics of discharged spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the U.S. commercial reactors. However, because of the extensive amount of data that has been collected and analyzed for UNFST\&DARDS, there are many more applications that can utilize the UDB including system analysis with the Next-Generation System Analysis Model (NGSAM) and fuel cycle analysis with fuel cycle simulation codes such as ORION. Going forward, NGSAM and fuel cycle transition analysis with ORION integrate UDB data wherever possible in the UDBâs development plan. These advances in NGSAM and fuel cycle analysis can be used in conjunction with the UDB to help answer more complex questions about the optimization, utilization, storage, and eventual disposal of SNF.},
